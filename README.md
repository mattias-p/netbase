# Netbase

Netbase is a library to make cached DNS and ASN lookups.
It is accompanied by a CLI tool (zcache) for working with cache files.

N.B. ASN lookups aren't implemented yet.

Netbase revolves around two central ideas.
First, that every network request should be recorded in the cache.
And second, that the cache miss strategy should be configurable to either simply
fail or to block while it's making a network request to populate the cache entry
before returning.

Netbase is short for network database.
Zcache is short for Zonemaster cache.

## Dependencies

To build netbase you need these:
* [FFI::Build::MM]
* [FFI::Build::File::Cargo]
* [cargo/rustc] (rustc >= 1.56)

In case you need to build FFI::Build::MM yourself you probably need these too:
* gcc
* OpenSSL development headers

## Install

```sh
perl Makefile.PL
sudo make install
```

## Run

These are the major ways to access the documentation:

```sh
zcache --help
zcache --help query
zcache --man
```

## Rationale

For several years the Zonemaster team has been throwing around the idea of
speeding up Zonemaster by reimplementing parts of it in a compiled language.
The part where reimplementation would make the most sense has been identified as
the low-level parts around networking in Zonemaster Engine.
I.e. the part to focus reimplementation on would be the caching.

I'm believer in the Unix philosophy to do one thing and do it well.
I'm also a believer in small steps.
So the scope of Netbase does not stretch above caching.

At the time of writing (in 2022) the general design of the current Zonemaster
caching implementation is already quite good. But there are a few wrinkles:

* Neither AXFR requests nor ASN lookups are included in the cache.
  This is problematic for the unit tests as well as when you want to save a
  recorded cache for later analysis.

* Timed out or otherwise failed request that result in retries are not included
  in the cache.
  Having this information in plain sight would be helpful when investigating
  behaviors of both the network and of Zonemaster Engine itself.

* There is no convenient way to list or dump the contents of a saved cache file.
  This would be very helpful when investigating why Zonemaster makes a certain
  analysis.

* There is no convenient way to make lookups into a cache file for specific
  requests or to update it with single requests.
  This would be useful in various development and troubleshooting contexts.

Solving the first two wrinkles is easy if we're reimplementing these parts of
the code anyway.

Given that we're reimplementing these parts, solving the last two wrinkles is
arguably easier than not solving them.
Having those features lets us try out the API with simple requests while it's
being developed.

### Technology choices

When it came to the choice of language I simply settled on Rust.
It's very performant, very reliable and if you ask me it's a language that's
generally nice to be around.

Once the C API is well defined and stable we should stop and think about whether
Rust is the compiled language we want to use.
If we decide it is, then good.
In case we aren't sure we can just reimplement the C API using a different
language for comparison.
This should be considerably easier than remaking this entire proof-of-concept
from scratch.

When it came to the choice of DNS library I opted to use trust_dns instead of
ldns which we're happy with in Zonemaster today.
To call ldns from Rust we'd have to create Rust bindings for it.
Using trust_dns was simply easier to get started with.
Since we're starting out with trust_dns we should evaluate that first.
If trust_dns doesn't measure up we still have the option to create Rust bindings
for good old ldns.

## Architecture

Netbase consists of two interfaces: a library (Netbase) and a CLI tool (zcache).

The CLI tool implements a few use cases that exercises all of the library API.

The library consists of three parts.

1. The business logic.
   This is where the actual functionality lives.
   It is implemented in safe Rust.
   Notably it uses trust_dns rather than ldns for making DNS requests.

   Another option would be to add Rust bindings for ldns so we can continue to
   use that.

2. The C API.
   This part defines C bindings for the business logic and exports them from a
   shared object.
   It is implemented in unsafe Rust.

3. The Perl API.
   This defines idiomatic Perl bindings for the C API.
   It is implemented in in pure Perl.
   It uses FFI::Platypus to attach the exported functions and perform the
   necessary type conversions.

   Another option would be to implement this part in XS and bypass
   FFI::Platypus.
   That would likely end up being slightly more performant but considerably more
   difficult and error prone.

### Integration with Zonemaster

This section presents a migration plan for how Netbase could be integrated in
Zonemaster Engine.

The raison d'Ãªtre of this proof of concept is to increase performance.
This migration plan makes a point of benchmarking so we can see what we won.

Netbase reimplements a small part of Zonemaster Engine and replaces most but not
all of Zonemaster LDNS.

One part of LDNS that is left out from Netbase is the fallback mechanism for
switching protocols when a truncated response is received.
It's helpful to have a record of the truncated response when debugging, so this
mechanism is best implemented above the caching layer.
Since Netbase is all about the caching it seems like a bad idea to add features
below the Netbase interface but above the cache layer.

Another part of LDNS that is left out from Netbase is the libidn bindings.
We should look into other ways to provide these bindings.
E.g. these bindings could be moved to Engine, or maybe there is a third party
library we could depend on.

#### Stage 0: Reference benchmark

* Develop a load test so we can measure how performance is affected as we make
  changes to the implementation.
* Make a benchmark of the performance using the current implementation.

#### Stage 1: Networking

Replace the querying of normal requests to use trust_dns instead of ldns.
I.e. non-AXFR requests.

* Update Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver::query to:
  * Call Netbase::Net::lookup for the actual query and take care of the returned
    wire formatted response.
  * Construct a Zonemaster::Engine::Packet using the response.
  * Implement the TC-flag fallback.
  * Make a benchmark when using trust_dns instead of ldns and with extra
    translation of questions and responses from and to the old representations.

#### Stage 2: Native responses

Make Zonemaster Engine use trust_dns's native response representation.

* Implement Perl bindings for all parts of trust_dns needed to replace
  Zonemaster::LDNS::Packet.
* Update Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver::query to not deserialize wire formatted
  responses.
* Without changing the public interface of Zonemaster::Engine::Packet, replace
  its implementation with Netbase.
* Make a benchmark without translation of response representations.

#### Stage 3: Native questions

Make Zonemaster Engine use Netbase's native question representation.

* Refactgor Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver::query and all its callers to use
  Netbase::Question in the interface.
* Make a benchmark without translation of question representations.

#### Stage 4: Caching

Replace the caching code with a compiled version.

* Without changing the public interface of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver and
  Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver::Cache, replace their implementations to use
  Netbase::Cache instead.
* Make a benchmark with a compiled cache implementation.

#### Stage 5: Include AXFR request in cache

Replace the querying of AXFR requests to use trust_dns instead of ldns.

* Update Netbase to be able to cache AXFR requests in a clean way does not
  interfere with the Zonemaster Engine analysis.
* Update Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver::axfr to use Netbase::Cache instead of
  Zonemaster::LDNS.

#### Stage 6: Cleaning up

Make Zonemaster Engine independent of Zonemaster LDNS.

* Remove Zonemaster LDNS as a dependency from Zonemaster Engine.

#### Bonus stage: Concurrent queries

Implement concurrent querying of multiple servers using the same question.

* Update the Rust networking, cache and FFI layers to handle multiple servers
  concurrently.
* Update Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver::query to take multiple server addresses
  and return a hash mapping server addresses to responses. (Or maybe add this as
  a new method?)
* Update all callers of Zonemaster::Engine::Nameserver::query to submit all
  servers in a single call.
* Make a benchmark with concurrent queries.

## Status

### Done (beta quality)
* FFI calls from Perl to Rust. (CLI tool in Perl, cache and networking in Rust.)
* DNS requests over UDP and TCP.
* Configurable timeout waiting for requests.
* Retrying failed requests with a delay in between tries.
* Configurable qname, qtype and RD flag in requests.
* Configurable EDNS header and fields. EDNS version and DO flag are complete.
  Option code support is sufficient for Zonemaster.
* Saving and loading cache files.
* Making lookups against the cache only. (I.e. without making network requests.)
* Usage documenation for all implemented features in the CLI tool.
* Listing all requests in a cache file.
* Dumping the complete contents of a cache file.
* Dig-like output from CLI tool. (Incl. all record types and OPT pseudo section.)
* Lookups to multiple servers with identical requests can be made in a single
  call. (We could rip it out to make fairer benchmarks.)
* Support setting the source address in requests.

### ToDo

#### Feature parity
* Support setting EDNS Z flags in requests.
  (https://docs.rs/trust-dns-client/latest/trust_dns_client/op/struct.Edns.html)
* Review the implemented feature set.
  Could Netbase support Zonemaster Engine without adding additional features or
  modifications?
* Add accessors for all parts of a DNS response that we need.

#### Robustness
* Make FFI robust with regard to panics in the Rust code.
  (https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Platypus::Lang::Rust#panics)
* Review FFI with regard to advice on object-based APIs.
  (https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/ffi/export.html)
* What happens if we `die` in Perl callbacks called from Rust?
  Could this be undefined behavior?
* Mitigate the risk for memory errors. (Using [Valgrind] or [UniFFI] or
  something).

#### Maintainability
* Revisit the naming of things to make it more consistent. Today there are
  little messes around at least lookups/queries/questions/requests, server/ns/ip
  and outcomes/responses/results.
* Revisit all parts of the Rust code and add unit tests for everything.

#### Future work
* Reusing TCP connections.
* Add a query parameter to delete all records from the answer, authority and
  additional sections. (To be used with AXFR requests.)
* Add support for ASN lookups.
  Both the Cymru and Ripe protocols.
